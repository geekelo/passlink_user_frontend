<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 PassLink <a name="about-project"></a>


"**PassLink** is an event check-in application built with React on the frontend and Ruby on Rails for the backend. It is designed to streamline the event check-in process, providing organizers and attendees with a seamless and efficient experience. Below, I'll outline the key aspects of PassLink, including its description, tech stack, development process, features, and how event check-ins are managed."

## Real-time Event Check-In:
PassLink simplifies the event check-in process by leveraging modern web technologies to provide real-time check-in capabilities. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

**Frontend Interaction:** When an attendee arrives at an event, they can use the PassLink app on their mobile device or desktop browser to check in. The React frontend captures the check-in request and sends it to the backend server for processing.
**Backend Processing:** The Ruby on Rails backend receives the check-in request, verifies the attendee's credentials, and updates the event attendance records in the database. It then sends a response back to the frontend to confirm the successful check-in.
**Real-time Updates:** The frontend receives the confirmation response from the backend and updates the user interface to reflect the attendee's check-in status in real-time.
